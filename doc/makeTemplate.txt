*makeTemplate.txt*   Plugin for creating build system templates

Author: pbalykov
Version: 1.0.0

This plugin provides commands to generate template files for various build 
systems including Make, QMake and CMake.

COMMANDS                                           *makeTemplate-commands*

:SamleMake~
    Creates a basic Makefile template in the current directory if it doesn't
    already exist. Opens the file in a new tab.

:SamleCMake~
    Creates a basic CMakeLists.txt template in the current directory if it 
    doesn't already exist. Opens the file in a new tab.

:SamleQmake {name}~
    Creates a QMake project file (.pro) with the specified name. Prompts the
    user to choose between terminal and GUI application templates.
    
    Example:
        :SamleQmake myproject

FUNCTIONS                                         *makeTemplate-functions*

FunSampleMake()~
    Generates a standard Makefile template with common targets (all, clean,
    run) and C++ compilation rules.

FunSampleCMake()~
    Generates a basic CMakeLists.txt template with C++17 standard and common
    compiler options.

FunSampleQmake(nameFile)~
    Generates a QMake project file. The user can choose between:
        1. Terminal application (core module)
        2. GUI application (core, gui, and widgets modules)

ArrQMake(value)~
    Returns the corresponding QMake template array:
        1 - Terminal application template
        2 - GUI application template

INSTALLATION                                      *makeTemplate-installation*

1. Copy makeTemplate.vim to your Vim plugin directory:
   - Linux/Mac: ~/.vim/plugin/
   - Windows: ~/vimfiles/plugin/

2. Restart Vim or reload your configuration.

USAGE                                             *makeTemplate-usage*

Simply run one of the provided commands in Vim while in your project 
directory. The plugin will check if the target file already exists and only 
create a new template if the file doesn't exist.

Example workflow:
    :cd ~/my_project
    :SamleCMake

This will create a CMakeLists.txt file with basic configuration in a new tab.
